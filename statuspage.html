<h3>big day in codeland. learned how to split elements in an array, then count the words in those elements. still trying to figure out exactly what the code is doing, but I think after counting frequency, it is storing a key,value pair with word,frequency in a tuple. It was then a matter of trial and error to figure out how to format that tuple (interestingly, the simplest part took the longest, since no one asks questions THAT remedial on stackoverflow) <br>
<br>
Like last time, I found the heavy lifting<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3173592/word-frequency-in-text-using-python-but-disregard-stop-words"> on stackoverflow</a>, which is a kickass resource for newbs</h3>
