	<p>A big five days for Twordsie! Since the last iteration:
	<li> We saw over 60 people use the site to find their most commonly tweeted words (ok I probably know about 40 of them). 
	<li> <a href = "http://twordsie.appspot.com/statuspage?user=alexmr">Alex</a> finally got off his a$$ and decided to help out, handling all of the front end fanciness you see before you. He's most proud of the sliding "project updates" that, since you're reading this, have just found.
	<li>Thanks to <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>, we finally figured out how to get this wordcloud to work! Check out my question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4179338/passing-django-template-variables-into-javascript-in-gae">here</a>. Stackoverflow user <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/280474/robert-kluin">Robert Kluin</a> was a huge help!
	<p>Alex and I are looking forward to building this out a bit more. We think it's a pretty fun tool and are learning a ton in the process of hacking it together. Stay tuned...!

	<p>big day in codeland. learned how to split elements in an array, then count the words in those elements. still trying to figure out exactly what the code is doing, but I think after counting frequency, it is storing a key,value pair with word,frequency in a tuple. It was then a matter of trial and error to figure out how to format that tuple (interestingly, the simplest part took the longest, since no one asks questions THAT remedial on stackoverflow) </p>
	<p>Like last time, I found the heavy lifting<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3173592/word-frequency-in-text-using-python-but-disregard-stop-words"> on stackoverflow</a>, which is a kickass resource for newbs</p>

	<p>woot, spitting out a nicely formatted array of the last 200 tweets (max available via API). thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter/wwarner">@wwarner</a> for help with json and for finding this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1171584/how-can-i-parse-json-in-google-app-engine">awesome thread on stackoverflow.</a></p>

	<strong>11/08/10</strong>
	<p>Created a bunch of finds and slices, now need to learn how to do this with a while loop.</p>
	<hr>
	<strong>11/07/10</strong>
	<p>I learned all about how to slice with Google's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk">corporate python courses.</a> Now to figure out how to slice multiple statuses into an array...</p>
